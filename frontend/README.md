# Digital Enrollment Frontend

This is a minimal TypeScript React frontend that uses the backend's REST compatibility endpoints.

Run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend should be running on `http://localhost:5000` (default). To change, set environment variable `VITE_API_BASE`.
